# machine-learning-intro

- This work was part of the machine learning introduction course I have taken during my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering @ IST

- It consists of four assignments compiling multiple machine learning basic algorithms and also includes some critical analysis about some topics

- The assignments can be found inside each folder. Each assignment is divided into two parts: the first one with theoretical questions solved "by hand" on the pen-and-paper pdf/word documents; and the second one consisting of programming exercises that also include some critical thoughts on the algorithms used, all solved using jupyter notebooks
